I find it interesting to have an AMA. This way anyone can ask something and read the answer.

*Anything* means **anything**. Personal questions. Money. Life. Code. Whatever.

P.S.
Well, I don't think any one will ask me questions here.
And I'm not sure I can answer any of the questions well, especially in English.

#### Guidelines

- Ensure your question haven't already been answered.
- Use a succinct title and description.
- Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
- Support questions are better asked on Stack Overflow.
- Chinese and English are recommended. Or I might have to translate it by Google.
